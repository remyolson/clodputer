- **Issue #2 VERIFIED**: Auto-detection working perfectly

#### Test 3.4: With Intelligent Task Generation
```bash
clodputer init --reset --claude-cli /Users/ro/.claude/local/claude --yes
```
‚úÖ **Result**: SUCCESS
- Step 3/7 ran "Analyzing your Claude Code setup..."
- Detected: "No MCPs detected" (correct, as none are configured)
- Gracefully fell back to template system
- Non-interactive mode skipped template import prompts

### [11:34] Phase 4: Diagnostics Validation

```bash
clodputer doctor
```
‚úÖ **All Checks Passing**:
- Tasks directory exists
- Queue lockfile
- Queue integrity
- Task configs valid
- Cron daemon running
- Clodputer cron jobs installed
- Cron job definitions valid
- Cron schedule preview
- Watcher daemon running
- Watch paths exist
- Watcher log directory available
- Claude CLI path configured (/Users/ro/.claude/local/claude)
- Onboarding completion recorded

## Findings & Observations

### ‚úÖ Issues Verified as Fixed

**Issue #1 (High Priority): Non-Interactive Onboarding Mode**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ VERIFIED FIXED
- All three non-interactive approaches work flawlessly:
  1. Explicit path with `--claude-cli /path/to/claude`
  2. Environment variable `CLODPUTER_CLAUDE_BIN`
  3. Auto-detection with `--yes` flag only
- No interactive prompts appeared when using `--yes`
- Flags `--no-templates` and `--no-automation` correctly skip those phases
- Enables CI/CD and automated testing workflows

**Issue #2 (Medium Priority): Claude CLI Auto-Detection**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ VERIFIED FIXED
- Auto-detection successfully found Claude CLI at correct path
- Message displayed: "Auto-detected Claude CLI at /Users/ro/.claude/local/claude"
- Works via `which claude` command or common paths
- No manual path entry required for users with standard Claude installations

**Issue #3 (Medium Priority): Installation Documentation**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ VERIFIED (documentation-only fix)
- README.md now clearly explains:
  - Developer preview status (not yet on PyPI)
  - macOS PEP 668 issue and venv requirement
  - Future pipx installation method
  - Warning against `--break-system-packages`

### üéØ Onboarding Quality Assessment

**Strengths**:
1. **Clean UX**: Well-formatted output with clear step-by-step progress (7 steps)
2. **Helpful Messages**: Each step shows what's happening (‚úì, ‚Ñπ, ‚Ä¢ symbols)
3. **Smart Defaults**: Auto-detection works seamlessly
4. **Non-Interactive Mode**: Perfect for automation
5. **Reset Functionality**: Works correctly to re-run onboarding
6. **Diagnostics**: Comprehensive `doctor` command shows system health
7. **MCP Detection**: Intelligently checks for MCPs and falls back to templates
8. **CLAUDE.md Integration**: Automatically updates user's CLAUDE.md file
9. **Logging**: All actions logged to `~/.clodputer/onboarding.log`

**Areas of Excellence**:
- Clear separation between required and optional steps
- Helpful "Next steps" guidance at end
- State persistence and backup mechanisms working
- All 11 diagnostic checks provide confidence in setup

### üìä Test Coverage Summary

| Test Scenario | Result | Notes |
|--------------|--------|-------|
| Fresh install from source | ‚úÖ PASS | Clean, fast installation |
| Non-interactive with explicit path | ‚úÖ PASS | --claude-cli flag works |
| Non-interactive with env var | ‚úÖ PASS | CLODPUTER_CLAUDE_BIN works |
| Non-interactive with auto-detect | ‚úÖ PASS | Auto-detection successful |
| Reset functionality | ‚úÖ PASS | --reset clears state |
| MCP detection | ‚úÖ PASS | Detects no MCPs, falls back |
| CLAUDE.md integration | ‚úÖ PASS | Already has guidance |
| State file creation | ‚úÖ PASS | All fields correct |
| Diagnostics | ‚úÖ PASS | 11/11 checks passing |

**Test Results**: 9/9 scenarios passed (100%)

### üö´ Issues Found

**None!** No new issues discovered during this test run. All three original issues are verified as fixed.

### üí° Potential Future Enhancements

While onboarding is working excellently, here are some optional improvements for the future:

1. **Interactive Mode Testing**: Consider adding automated tests for interactive prompts (using Click's CliRunner with input parameter)
2. **Template Testing**: Could test template installation flow when user has no existing templates
3. **Smoke Test**: Could test the smoke test feature when tasks are actually configured
4. **Automation Setup**: Could test cron/watcher setup (declined for safety in this test)

These are **nice-to-haves**, not blockers. The onboarding is production-ready as-is.
