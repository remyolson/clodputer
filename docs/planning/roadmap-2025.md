# Clodputer 2025 Roadmap

**Document Version:** 2.0
**Last Updated:** January 2025
**Status:** Active Development
**Current Version:** 0.1.0 (Developer Preview)

---

## üéØ Vision & Goals

**Mission:** Make Claude Code work autonomously in the background, enabling "set it and forget it" automation that feels magical.

**Core Insight:** **Claude Code is Clodputer's primary user.** All features should prioritize making automation seamless for Claude Code during conversations with humans.

**Core Pillars:**
1. **Claude-Native First** - Deep integration with Claude Code's workflow
2. **Reliability Always** - Tasks execute consistently without surprises
3. **Delightful UX** - Onboarding and daily use feel effortless
4. **Visible Progress** - Users always know what's happening

**Target Audience:**
- Claude Code (primary user) - needs programmatic task creation
- Power users who want automation
- Knowledge workers with repetitive workflows
- Developers who want AI assistance on a schedule

---

## üìä Current State (January 2025)

### ‚úÖ What's Built
- **Core Engine:** Queue, executor, cron, watcher (100% functional)
- **Onboarding:** Guided setup with intelligent task generation (80% test coverage)
- **Safety:** PID tracking, atomic writes, crash recovery
- **UI:** Terminal dashboard + macOS menu bar
- **Testing:** 205 tests, 80% coverage, zero flaky tests

### üöß What's Missing (Critical for Claude Code)
- **No programmatic task creation** - Claude has to tell humans to edit YAML
- **No task discovery API** - Claude can't query existing tasks
- **No task state storage** - Tasks are stateless, can't remember context
- **No results API** - Claude can't check if tasks succeeded
- **Task authoring complexity** - Manual YAML editing required

### üìà Metrics
- **Test Coverage:** 80.01%
- **Onboarding Time:** ~5-8 minutes (target: <3 minutes)
- **Task Success Rate:** Unknown (need instrumentation)
- **Claude Code Integration:** 0% (no programmatic API exists)

---

## üìÖ Phase 1: Claude-Native Foundation (Weeks 1-3) üî•

**Timeline:** 3 weeks
**Goal:** Claude Code can create, query, and manage tasks programmatically in <30 seconds

**Philosophy:** Claude Code should never tell humans to edit YAML files. All task operations should be possible via CLI with JSON input/output.

---

### Feature 1.1: JSON Task Creation API (Week 1)
**Problem:** Claude Code has to instruct humans to manually edit YAML files

**Current painful flow:**
```
User: "Check my email daily"
Claude: "Please edit ~/.clodputer/tasks/email.yaml and add this YAML..."
Human: *manually edits file*
Claude: "Now run: clodputer run email"
```

**New seamless flow:**
```
User: "Check my email daily"
Claude: *creates task directly*
Claude: "‚úÖ Set up 'daily-email-check' to run at 8am daily."
```

**Implementation:**
```
1. Add JSON-based task creation
   - `clodputer create-task --json '{...}'`
   - `echo '{...}' | clodputer create-task --stdin`
   - Returns: task ID, path, status as JSON

2. JSON schema validation
   - Validate against TaskConfig schema
   - Return clear error messages for invalid JSON
   - Support both full config and minimal config

3. Quick-create shortcuts
   - `clodputer create-task --name X --prompt "..." --schedule "0 8 * * *"`
   - Mix JSON and CLI args (CLI args override JSON)

4. Test immediately option
   - `clodputer create-task --json '{...}' --test`
   - Creates task and runs it once
   - Returns creation result + execution result
```

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/clodputer/cli.py` - Add create-task command
- `src/clodputer/config.py` - Add JSON serialization methods
- `tests/test_cli.py` - Test create-task command
- `docs/user/cli-reference.md` - Document new command

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] `clodputer create-task --json` works
- [ ] `--stdin` accepts piped JSON
- [ ] Returns JSON result with task path
- [ ] Validates config before creation
- [ ] 6 new tests added

**Time Estimate:** 3-4 days

---

### Feature 1.2: Task Query & Discovery API (Week 1)
**Problem:** Claude Code can't discover what tasks already exist

**Implementation:**
```
1. Add --format json flag to existing commands
   - `clodputer list --format json`
   - `clodputer status --format json`
   - `clodputer queue --format json`
   - Returns: structured JSON instead of formatted text

2. Add task inspection command
   - `clodputer inspect <task> --format json`
   - Returns: full config + metadata
   - Include: last run, success rate, next scheduled run

3. Add task search
   - `clodputer search "email" --format json`
   - Search by: name, prompt text, tools used
   - Returns: matching tasks as JSON array

4. Add health check
   - `clodputer health-check --format json`
   - Returns: tasks with issues (failed recently, etc.)
```

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/clodputer/cli.py` - Add --format json to commands
- `src/clodputer/cli.py` - Add inspect and search commands
- `src/clodputer/formatting.py` - Add JSON formatters
- `tests/test_cli.py` - Test JSON output

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] All list commands support --format json
- [ ] `clodputer inspect` returns full task details
- [ ] `clodputer search` finds tasks by keyword
- [ ] JSON output is valid and parseable
- [ ] 5 new tests added

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 days

---

### Feature 1.3: Task State Storage (Week 2)
**Problem:** Tasks are stateless - can't remember context between runs

**Example use case:**
```
Task: "Summarize my emails daily"
Run 1: Processes 50 emails
Run 2: Should only process NEW emails since Run 1
Current: Claude has no memory of previous run ‚ùå
Needed: Task remembers last processed email ID ‚úÖ
```

**Implementation:**
```
1. Add state storage to task config
   state:
     enabled: true
     storage: ~/.clodputer/state/{task_name}.json
     max_size: 1MB  # Prevent unbounded growth

2. State API commands
   - `clodputer state get <task>` - read current state
   - `clodputer state get <task> --key last_id` - read specific key
   - `clodputer state set <task> --json '{...}'` - write state
   - `clodputer state clear <task>` - reset state

3. State interpolation in prompts
   - {{state.last_processed_id}} - access state in task prompt
   - {{state.processed_count}} - access counters
   - If state missing, value is empty string

4. State management in executor
   - Load state before task execution
   - Save state after task completion
   - Atomic writes to prevent corruption

5. State in task output
   - Tasks can write: {"state": {"last_id": "xyz"}}
   - Executor automatically saves to state file
```

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/clodputer/config.py` - Add StateConfig model
- `src/clodputer/state.py` - New module for state management
- `src/clodputer/executor.py` - Load/save state during execution
- `src/clodputer/cli.py` - Add state commands
- `tests/test_state.py` - Test state operations

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Tasks can persist state between runs
- [ ] State accessible in prompts via {{state.key}}
- [ ] CLI commands for state management work
- [ ] State survives task failures
- [ ] 8 new tests added

**Time Estimate:** 4-5 days

---

### Feature 1.4: Quick Task Modification (Week 2)
**Problem:** Updating tasks requires manual YAML editing

**Implementation:**
```
1. Modify command
   - `clodputer modify <task> --schedule "0 9 * * *"`
   - `clodputer modify <task> --prompt "New prompt"`
   - `clodputer modify <task> --add-tool mcp__calendar`
   - `clodputer modify <task> --remove-tool Read`
   - `clodputer modify <task> --timeout 300`
   - `clodputer modify <task> --enable`
   - `clodputer modify <task> --disable`

2. Atomic updates
   - Read current config
   - Apply modification
   - Validate new config
   - Write atomically (backup created)

3. Bulk modifications
   - `clodputer modify <task> --json '{"schedule": "...", "timeout": 300}'`
   - Apply multiple changes in one command

4. Dry-run mode
   - `clodputer modify <task> --schedule "..." --dry-run`
   - Shows what would change without applying
```

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/clodputer/cli.py` - Add modify command
- `src/clodputer/config.py` - Add atomic update methods
- `tests/test_cli.py` - Test modify command

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Can modify schedule, prompt, tools, timeout
- [ ] Changes validated before applying
- [ ] Backup created before modification
- [ ] Dry-run shows changes without applying
- [ ] 5 new tests added

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 days

---

### Feature 1.5: Results API (Week 3)
**Problem:** Claude Code can't check if tasks succeeded

**Implementation:**
```
1. JSON results format
   - `clodputer results <task> --latest --format json`
   - Returns: {status, duration, output, error, timestamp}

2. Results summary
   - `clodputer results <task> --summary --since "7 days"`
   - Returns: {runs, success, failure, avg_duration}

3. Filter results
   - `clodputer results <task> --failed --format json`
   - `clodputer results <task> --limit 10 --format json`

4. Health check
   - `clodputer health-check --format json`
   - Returns: tasks needing attention
   - Criteria: recent failures, long runtime, etc.
```

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/clodputer/cli.py` - Add --format json to results
- `src/clodputer/cli.py` - Add health-check command
- `src/clodputer/executor.py` - Ensure results saved as JSON
- `tests/test_cli.py` - Test results commands

- [ ] Summary provides useful stats
- [ ] Health check identifies problem tasks
- [ ] Results persist across task runs
- [ ] 4 new tests added

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 days

---

### Feature 1.6: CLAUDE.md Integration Guide (Week 3)
**Problem:** Claude Code doesn't know how to use new APIs

**Implementation:**
```
1. Add comprehensive Clodputer section to CLAUDE.md template

   ## Clodputer: Autonomous Task Automation (For Claude Code)

   When the user requests automation, use these commands:

   ### Create a task (programmatically)
   clodputer create-task --json '{
     "name": "daily-email-check",
     "schedule": "0 8 * * *",
     "task": {
       "prompt": "Check my email and draft responses",
       "allowed_tools": ["mcp__gmail", "Read", "Write"]
     }
   }'

   ### Check existing tasks
   clodputer list --format json | jq '.[] | {name, schedule}'

   ### Get task details
   clodputer inspect daily-email-check --format json

   ### Check results
   clodputer results daily-email-check --latest --format json

   ### Modify task
   clodputer modify daily-email-check --schedule "0 9 * * *"

   ### Manage task state
   clodputer state get daily-email-check
   clodputer state set daily-email-check --json '{"last_id": "xyz"}'

   ### Use state in prompts
   Your last run processed {{state.processed_count}} emails.
   Continue from email ID {{state.last_email_id}}.

2. Example workflows
   - Email automation with state
   - File watching with results checking
   - Multi-step tasks with dependencies (coming in Phase 6)

3. Best practices
   - Always check if task exists before creating
   - Use state for incremental processing
   - Check results before reporting success
   - Use --dry-run for safety
```

**Files to Modify:**
- `docs/planning/CLAUDE-MD-ADDITION.md` - Update with new section
- `src/clodputer/onboarding.py` - Include in CLAUDE.md during init

### Risk: Breaking Changes to JSON Schema
**Mitigation:** Version JSON schema, support migration

### Risk: Feature Creep
**Mitigation:** Strict phase boundaries, user testing between phases

### Risk: Claude API Changes
**Mitigation:** Version detection, graceful degradation

---

## üéì Learning & Iteration

### After Each Phase
1. **User Testing** (5-10 users)
2. **Claude Code Testing** (real conversations)
3. **Metrics Review** (compare to targets)
4. **Retrospective** (what worked, what didn't)

### Continuous Feedback
- Weekly check-ins with early users
- Claude Code integration testing
- GitHub issues for feature requests
- Discord/Slack for quick feedback

---

## üí° Example: Ideal Claude Code Workflow (Phase 1 Complete)

**User:** "Can you check my email every morning and draft responses to urgent messages?"

**Claude Code:**
```bash
# 1. Check if similar task exists
clodputer list --format json | jq '.[] | select(.name | contains("email"))'

# 2. Create task programmatically
clodputer create-task --json '{
  "name": "daily-email-check",
  "enabled": true,
  "schedule": "0 8 * * *",
  "task": {
    "prompt": "Check my email and draft responses to urgent messages. Use state to track processed emails.",
    "allowed_tools": ["mcp__gmail", "Read", "Write"],
    "timeout": 300
  },
  "state": {
    "enabled": true
  }
}' --test

# 3. Check result
clodputer results daily-email-check --latest --format json

# 4. Confirm to user
```

**Claude Code (to user):** "‚úÖ I've set up 'daily-email-check' to run at 8am daily. Just tested it - drafted 3 responses. The task will remember which emails it's processed so it won't duplicate work."

**Time:** <30 seconds
**Manual YAML editing:** 0
**Human intervention:** 0

## üìù Appendices

### Appendix A: Why Claude-Native First?

**The Problem:**
Currently, when a user asks Claude Code to automate something, Claude has to:
1. Explain what Clodputer is
2. Tell the user to manually create a YAML file
3. Guide them through the YAML structure
4. Tell them to run `clodputer run <task>`
5. Hope they did it correctly

This is a **terrible experience** for both Claude and the user.

**The Solution:**
With Phase 1 complete, Claude Code can:
1. Create task in one command
2. Test it immediately
3. Report results
4. Done

This is **transformative** for the primary user (Claude Code).
