## üìÖ Phase 1: Core Reliability (Weeks 1-3)

**Timeline:** 3 weeks
**Goal:** Users trust that tasks execute reliably and can debug when they don't

### Feature 1.1: Task Execution Reports (Week 1)
**Problem:** When tasks fail, users have no easy way to understand why

**Implementation:**
```
1. Create output directory structure
   - ~/.clodputer/outputs/<task-name>/
   - Store results as: YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.json

2. Extend executor.py to save task results
   - Save full TaskExecutionResult as JSON
   - Include: status, duration, return_code, stdout, stderr, error
   - Add markdown summary: <timestamp>.md

3. Add result viewing command
   - `clodputer results <task-name>` - show last 10 runs
   - `clodputer results <task-name> --latest` - show last run
   - `clodputer results <task-name> --failed` - show failed runs only
   - Format: table with timestamp, status, duration, error

4. Add result cleanup
   - Keep last 100 results per task (configurable)
   - Auto-delete results older than 30 days
   - Add to cleanup.py
```

**Files to Modify:**

```
1. Add retry configuration to task YAML
   retry:
     enabled: true
     max_attempts: 3
     backoff: exponential  # or 'fixed'
     initial_delay: 60     # seconds
     max_delay: 3600       # 1 hour

2. Enhance executor retry logic
   - Calculate next retry time with backoff
   - Store retry attempt count in queue metadata
   - Log retry attempts with reasoning

3. Add retry status to queue
   - Show "Retry 2/3 in 4m" in status output
   - Display retry history in task results

4. Add retry policy types
   - Exponential: 1m, 2m, 4m, 8m...
   - Fixed: 5m, 5m, 5m...

### Feature 5.3: Self-Healing Tasks (Week 16)
**Problem:** Tasks fail repeatedly without intervention

**Implementation:**
```
1. Detect failure patterns
   - Same error multiple times
   - Consistent failure at specific time
   - Resource-related failures (timeout, OOM)
   - Tool availability issues

2. Auto-apply fixes
   - Timeout errors ‚Üí increase timeout
   - Parse errors ‚Üí suggest prompt improvement
   - MCP unavailable ‚Üí skip task, retry later
   - Rate limit ‚Üí add exponential backoff

3. Healing actions
   Auto-fix:
   - Increase timeout after 3 consecutive timeout failures
   - Add retry delay after rate limit errors
   - Skip execution after 5 consecutive MCP failures

   Suggest to user:
   - "Task X times out often. Increase timeout?"
   - "Task Y hits rate limits. Add delay between runs?"
   - "Task Z uses deprecated tool. Update to new tool?"

4. Learning from fixes
   - Track which fixes work
   - Apply successful patterns to similar tasks
   - Build knowledge base of solutions

5. Report on healing
   - Show: "üîß Auto-fixed 3 tasks this week"
   - List applied fixes
   - Show success rate improvement
```

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/clodputer/healing.py` - New module
- `src/clodputer/executor.py` - Integrate healing
- `src/clodputer/cli.py` - Add healing report
- `tests/test_healing.py` - Test healing logic

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Failure patterns detected
- [ ] Auto-fixes applied correctly
- [ ] Suggestions presented to user
- [ ] Success rate improves after fixes
- [ ] 7 new tests added

**Time Estimate:** 5-6 days
