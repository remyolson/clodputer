# Phase 5-6 Implementation Priorities

**Created:** January 2025
**Status:** Planning

## Prioritization Rationale

Based on:
- User preference for practical features over polish
- Claude Code as primary user
- "Set it and forget it" automation goal
- Avoiding unnecessary complexity

## High Priority Features (Implement First)

### 1. Task Dependencies (Feature 6.5) ğŸ”¥ PRIORITY 1
**Why:** Enables complex workflows, unlocks real automation value

**Implementation:**
```yaml
name: send-summary
depends_on:
  - task: process-emails
    condition: success  # or "complete", "always"
    max_age: 3600  # seconds (optional)
```

**What it enables:**
- Sequential task execution
- Conditional task triggering
- Multi-step workflows
- Failure isolation

**Scope:**
- Week 1: Dependency schema + validation
- Week 2: Execution engine integration
- Week 3: CLI commands + testing

**Estimated Time:** 3 weeks

### 2. Natural Language Task Generation (Feature 6.4) ğŸ”¥ PRIORITY 2
**Why:** Makes Claude Code integration seamless, dramatically improves UX

**Implementation:**
```bash
clodputer generate-task \
  --description "Check my email every morning at 8am and draft responses"

# Uses Claude CLI to convert description â†’ task config
# Validates and creates automatically
```

**What it enables:**
- Zero YAML knowledge required
- Claude Code can create tasks from natural language
- Reduces cognitive load for users

**Scope:**
- Week 1: Claude CLI integration
- Week 2: Prompt engineering for task generation
- Week 3: Validation + testing

**Estimated Time:** 3 weeks

---

## Medium Priority Features (If Time Permits)

### 3. Real-Time Dashboard (Feature 5.1)
**Why:** Deferred from Phase 2.3, provides execution visibility

**Implementation:**
- Live output streaming from running tasks
- File-based event tailing
- Syntax highlighting for logs

**Estimated Time:** 2 weeks

---

## Low Priority Features (Deferred)

### 4. Enhanced Menu Bar (Feature 5.2)
**Why:** Incremental improvement, not critical

**Deferred because:**
- Current menu bar is functional
- Focus on core automation features first

### 5. Visual Polish (Feature 5.3)
**Why:** Nice to have, not essential

**Deferred because:**
- Loading animations, keyboard shortcuts, celebrations don't add functional value
- Can be added later based on user feedback

### 6. Silent Task Optimization (Feature 6.1)
**Why:** Advanced feature, requires significant ML/tuning work

**Deferred because:**
- Automatic config tuning is complex
- Users can manually optimize tasks
- Better to nail core features first

### 7. Passive Analytics (Feature 6.2)
**Why:** Useful but not critical for MVP

**Deferred because:**
- Background metrics nice to have
- Can use logs for debugging
- Add when there's clear demand

### 8. Silent Self-Healing (Feature 6.3)
**Why:** Very advanced, high complexity

**Deferred because:**
- Automatic failure recovery is complex
- Pattern-based fixes require significant work
- Focus on preventing failures first

## Implementation Plan

### Next 6 Weeks

**Weeks 1-3: Task Dependencies (Feature 6.5)**
- Add dependency schema to TaskConfig
- Implement dependency resolution engine
- Add CLI commands for dependency management
- Comprehensive testing

**Weeks 4-6: Natural Language Task Generation (Feature 6.4)**
- Integrate with Claude CLI
- Build prompt templates for task generation
- Add validation and error handling
- User testing and refinement

### After Week 6: Evaluate

Based on:
- User feedback on dependencies + NL generation
- Time remaining to v1.0.0
- New feature requests

Decide whether to:
- Implement Real-Time Dashboard (5.1)
- Polish existing features
- Focus on documentation and stability

---

## Success Metrics

**Task Dependencies:**
- Can chain 3+ tasks successfully
- Conditional execution works reliably
- Clear error messages when dependencies fail

**Natural Language Generation:**
- >80% of generated tasks are valid
- <30 seconds from description to runnable task
- Works for common automation scenarios

---

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk:** Dependency cycles
**Mitigation:** Detect and reject circular dependencies during validation

**Risk:** NL generation creates incorrect tasks
**Mitigation:** Always show generated config, require user confirmation

**Risk:** Scope creep
**Mitigation:** Stick to defined scope, defer enhancements to future phases

---

**Decision:** Start with Task Dependencies (Feature 6.5) - most impactful for automation workflows.
