# Installation & Claude Code Integration

**Date**: October 7, 2025
**Question**: How does Claude Code know about Clodputer?

---

## The CLAUDE.md Problem

**You're exactly right!** Claude Code needs to know:
1. That Clodputer exists
2. How to use it
3. When to create task configs
4. What the YAML schema is

**Solution**: The installation process **automatically updates your CLAUDE.md file**.

---

## Installation Flow (Complete)

### Step 1: User Installs Clodputer

```bash
$ brew install clodputer
```

**Homebrew installs**:
- `clodputer` CLI binary ‚Üí `/usr/local/bin/`
- Python package ‚Üí `/usr/local/lib/python3.x/site-packages/`
- Menu bar app ‚Üí `/Applications/Clodputer.app`

### Step 2: User Runs Setup

```bash
$ clodputer setup
```

**Setup script does**:
1. Creates directory structure (`~/.clodputer/`)
2. Checks dependencies (Claude Code, fswatch, etc.)
3. Copies templates
4. **Automatically adds Clodputer section to CLAUDE.md** ‚≠ê
5. Starts menu bar app

### Step 3: CLAUDE.md Auto-Update

**The setup command detects your CLAUDE.md location** and appends Clodputer instructions.

**Detection logic**:
```python
# Clodputer setup looks for CLAUDE.md in common locations:
claude_md_paths = [
    "~/CLAUDE.md",                    # Your current location
    "~/.config/claude/CLAUDE.md",     # Alternative
    "~/Documents/CLAUDE.md",          # Alternative
]

# If found, append Clodputer section
if claude_md_exists:
    append_to_claude_md()
else:
    # Ask user where their CLAUDE.md is
    print("Where is your CLAUDE.md file?")
    path = input("Path: ")
    append_to_file(path)
```

### Step 4: What Gets Added to CLAUDE.md

**Installation appends this section** (from the `CLAUDE-MD-ADDITION.md` file we created earlier):

```markdown
## Clodputer: Autonomous Task Automation

Clodputer enables you to create autonomous tasks that run automatically via cron schedules or file watchers.

### Creating Automated Tasks

When a user asks you to create an automated task (e.g., "I want you to draft email responses every morning at 8 AM"), follow these steps:

1. **Determine task type**:
   - **Scheduled**: Runs on a cron schedule (e.g., daily, hourly)
   - **File-triggered**: Runs when files appear/change in a directory
   - **Manual**: Runs only when explicitly invoked

2. **Create task configuration file** in `~/.clodputer/tasks/[task-name].yaml`

3. **Use this YAML schema**:
[... full schema from earlier ...]

4. **After creating the config**, tell the user:
   - "I've created the task configuration at ~/.clodputer/tasks/[name].yaml"
   - If scheduled: "Run `clodputer install` to activate the cron job"
   - If file-watch: "Run `clodputer watch --daemon` to start monitoring"
   - "You can test it manually with: `clodputer run [task-name]`"

[... rest of instructions ...]
```

**This is the KEY**: Once this is in CLAUDE.md, every Claude Code session knows about Clodputer!

## How Claude Code Becomes Aware

### Before Installation

**User asks Claude Code**: "Create a task to draft emails daily"

**Claude Code response**: "I don't have information about how to create automated tasks. Could you clarify what system you're using?"

‚ùå Claude Code doesn't know about Clodputer

### After Installation (CLAUDE.md Updated)

**User asks Claude Code**: "Create a task to draft emails daily"

**Claude Code response** (reads CLAUDE.md, sees Clodputer section):

```
I'll create a Clodputer task for daily email drafting.

[Creates ~/.clodputer/tasks/email-management.yaml with proper schema]

Task created successfully!

To activate:
  clodputer install

Test now:
  clodputer run email-management

This task will run automatically every day at your specified time.
```

‚úÖ Claude Code knows exactly what to do

---

## User Experience Summary

### Installation Day

```bash
# 1. User installs
$ brew install clodputer
$ clodputer setup

‚úÖ Clodputer setup complete!
‚úÖ Added Clodputer section to ~/CLAUDE.md
ü§ñ Menu bar icon will appear on next login

# 2. User immediately tries it
$ claude

User: "Create a task to draft emails at 8 AM daily"

Claude Code: [Reads updated CLAUDE.md]
Claude Code: "I'll create a Clodputer task..."
Claude Code: [Creates ~/.clodputer/tasks/email-management.yaml]
Claude Code: "Task created! Run 'clodputer install' to activate."

User: "Activate it now"

Claude Code: [Runs: clodputer install]
Claude Code: "‚úÖ Cron job installed. First run: tomorrow 8 AM"

# 3. Done!
```

**Key insight**: The installation automatically teaches Claude Code how to use Clodputer by updating CLAUDE.md.

---

## What If User Doesn't Have CLAUDE.md?

### Scenario: Fresh Claude Code User

**If `clodputer setup` doesn't find CLAUDE.md**:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è  CLAUDE.md not found in standard locations.

Clodputer needs to add instructions to your CLAUDE.md file
so Claude Code knows how to create automated tasks.

Options:
  1. Provide path to existing CLAUDE.md
  2. Create a new CLAUDE.md at ~/CLAUDE.md
  3. Skip (Claude Code won't know about Clodputer)

Your choice (1/2/3): 2

‚úÖ Created ~/CLAUDE.md with Clodputer instructions

Next: Restart any active Claude Code sessions to pick up changes.
```

**What gets created**:
```markdown
# Claude Configuration

[Minimal header with your info]

## Clodputer: Autonomous Task Automation

[Full Clodputer instructions from CLAUDE-MD-ADDITION.md]
```

---

## Alternative: Manual Integration

### If User Wants to Add Manually

**Documentation includes**:

```markdown
# Manual Integration with CLAUDE.md

If you prefer to manually add Clodputer support to your CLAUDE.md:

1. Open your CLAUDE.md file:
   $ code ~/CLAUDE.md

2. Copy the contents of this file:
   $ cat ~/.clodputer/docs/CLAUDE-MD-ADDITION.md

3. Paste at the end of your CLAUDE.md

4. Save and restart Claude Code sessions

Done! Claude Code now knows about Clodputer.
```

**The addition file is included** at `~/.clodputer/docs/CLAUDE-MD-ADDITION.md`

---

## Keeping CLAUDE.md Updated

### When Clodputer Updates

**If Clodputer gains new features** (e.g., multi-turn support in Phase 2):

```bash
$ brew upgrade clodputer
$ clodputer update-docs
```

**`update-docs` command**:
- Checks current CLAUDE.md Clodputer section
- Compares to latest template
- Shows diff
- Asks to update

```
üìù Clodputer Documentation Update Available

Changes:
  + Added: Multi-turn task support
  + Added: Cost tracking features
  ~ Updated: YAML schema with new fields

Update your CLAUDE.md? (y/n): y

‚úÖ Updated Clodputer section in ~/CLAUDE.md
‚ú® Claude Code now knows about new features
```

---

## Uninstallation

### If User Wants to Remove Clodputer

```bash
$ clodputer uninstall
```

**Uninstaller does**:
1. Removes cron jobs
2. Stops file watchers
3. Removes menu bar app
4. **Removes Clodputer section from CLAUDE.md** ‚≠ê
5. Optionally deletes `~/.clodputer/` directory

```
üóëÔ∏è  Uninstalling Clodputer...

‚úÖ Removed cron jobs
‚úÖ Stopped file watchers
‚úÖ Removed menu bar app
‚úÖ Removed Clodputer section from ~/CLAUDE.md

Keep task configs and logs? (y/n): n

‚úÖ Deleted ~/.clodputer/

Clodputer has been completely removed.
Claude Code will no longer know about Clodputer.
```

---

## Summary: The Integration Flow

1. **User installs** Clodputer via Homebrew
2. **Setup script runs**, finds CLAUDE.md
3. **Automatically appends** Clodputer instructions to CLAUDE.md
4. **Claude Code reads** CLAUDE.md on every session start
5. **Claude Code now knows** how to create Clodputer tasks
6. **User just talks** to Claude Code naturally
7. **Claude Code creates** properly formatted task configs
8. **Clodputer executes** tasks autonomously

**The magic**: Updating CLAUDE.md makes Claude Code instantly aware of Clodputer without any code changes to Claude Code itself.

---

## Questions Answered

**Q: Does installation edit CLAUDE.md?**
‚úÖ Yes, automatically appends Clodputer section

**Q: How does Claude Code know about Clodputer?**
‚úÖ Reads instructions from CLAUDE.md on every session

**Q: What if CLAUDE.md doesn't exist?**
‚úÖ Setup creates one or asks for location

**Q: Can I see what will be added before installation?**
‚úÖ Yes: `cat ~/.clodputer/docs/CLAUDE-MD-ADDITION.md`

**Q: Can I manually add instead of auto-install?**
‚úÖ Yes, copy from CLAUDE-MD-ADDITION.md

**Q: What if I update Clodputer later?**
‚úÖ Run `clodputer update-docs` to refresh CLAUDE.md section

---

Does this clarify the installation and integration process?
