## Critical Decisions

### 1. Instance Management Strategy

**Question**: How should we manage Claude Code instance lifecycle?

**Options**:

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Recommended For |
|----------|------|------|-----------------|
| **A. On-Demand Spawning** | Simple, fault-isolated, easy debugging | 5-10s MCP startup per task, higher cost | MVP, infrequent tasks (2-3x per day) |
| **B. Persistent Instance** | Fast execution, shared context, minimal overhead | Complex streaming, single point of failure | High-frequency tasks (>10x per day) |
| **C. Session Pool (2-3 instances)** | Balanced performance, concurrent execution | Moderate complexity, session coordination | Production with mixed workloads |

**Recommendation**: **Start with A (On-Demand)**, validate use cases, then consider C (Session Pool) if performance becomes a bottleneck.

**Your Input Needed**:
- How frequently do you expect to run automated tasks?
  - Hourly? Daily? On-demand only?
- Is 5-10 second startup latency acceptable for your use cases?
- Do you anticipate needing concurrent task execution?

### 2. Multi-Turn Conversation Priority

**Question**: How critical is maintaining conversation context across multiple prompts?

**Context**: Your email example is single-turn (read emails → draft responses → save). Your project example is multi-turn (read file → execute task 1 → check completion → execute task 2 → etc.).

**Trade-off**:
- **Single-turn only (Phase 1)**: Faster to implement, simpler architecture, works for 80% of use cases
- **Multi-turn support (Phase 2)**: Required for complex projects, adds complexity, enables more sophisticated workflows

**Recommendation**: **Validate with single-turn MVP first**. Many tasks can be reformulated as single comprehensive prompts. Add multi-turn in Phase 2 only if proven necessary.

**Your Input Needed**:
- Which of your envisioned use cases truly require multi-turn conversations?
- Can project execution be handled by a single well-structured prompt that says "execute all tasks in sequence and update the file as you go"?
- Would you accept a hybrid: simple tasks are single-turn, complex projects use multi-turn?

### 3. Resource Control Philosophy

**Question**: How should we handle resource limits and concurrent execution?

**Options**:

| Approach | Description | Pros | Cons |
|----------|-------------|------|------|
| **A. Naive** | No limits, unlimited concurrency | Simple, fast development | Risk of resource exhaustion |
| **B. Hard Limits** | Max N instances, queue excess | Predictable resource usage | Tasks may be delayed |
| **C. Adaptive** | Monitor CPU/memory, throttle dynamically | Optimal resource utilization | Complex implementation |

**Recommendation**: **Start with B (Hard Limits)** - set max concurrent instances to 2-3, queue additional tasks. Add A (Adaptive) monitoring in Phase 3 if needed.

**Your Input Needed**:
- What's your system's available resources? (CPU cores, RAM)
- How many concurrent automation tasks do you anticipate running?
- Is it acceptable for tasks to wait in a queue, or must they execute immediately?

---

### 4. Configuration Complexity

**Question**: How much configuration flexibility do you need vs. simplicity?

**Options**:

| Level | Configuration Style | Pros | Cons |
|-------|---------------------|------|------|
| **Simple** | Minimal YAML: prompt, schedule, tools | Easy to understand, quick setup | Limited customization |
| **Medium** | Structured config: multi-step tasks, hooks, conditions | Balance of power and usability | Moderate learning curve |
| **Advanced** | Full programmability: Python/JS task definitions | Maximum flexibility | Steep learning curve, harder to share |

**Recommendation**: **Start with Simple**, expand to Medium as needs emerge. Keep advanced as "escape hatch" for power users.

**Example Simple Config**:
```yaml
name: email-management
schedule: "0 8 * * *"
prompt: "Read unread emails, draft responses, save to ~/email-responses/"
tools: [Read, Write, mcp__gmail]
```

**Example Medium Config**:
```yaml
name: project-execution
trigger:
  type: file_watch
  path: ~/todos/claude-assignments
  pattern: "*.md"

task:
  steps:
    - Read project file
    - Execute tasks sequentially
    - Update status in file

  tools: [Read, Write, Edit, Bash]
  completion_check: "all tasks marked complete"
```

**Your Input Needed**:
- Do you want to write task configs yourself, or should they be pre-built templates you just enable?
- How comfortable are you with YAML syntax?
- Do you need conditional logic (if/then), or are linear task sequences sufficient?

---

### 5. Error Handling Strategy

**Question**: How should Clodputer handle failures?

**Options**:

| Strategy | Behavior | Pros | Cons |
|----------|----------|------|------|
| **Fail Fast** | Log error, stop, alert | Simple, clear failure state | Brittle, requires manual intervention |
| **Retry with Backoff** | Retry 3x with exponential delay | Handles transient failures | May waste resources on permanent failures |
| **Smart Retry** | Analyze error, retry only if recoverable | Efficient, self-healing | Complex error classification |

**Recommendation**: **Start with Fail Fast + Manual Retry**, add Retry with Backoff in Phase 3.

**Your Input Needed**:
- How critical is uptime for your automation? (Can tasks fail occasionally?)
- Should failed tasks alert you immediately, or just log for later review?
- Are there specific failure modes you're concerned about? (API rate limits, file permissions, etc.)

---

### 6. Security & Sandboxing

**Question**: How much should we restrict task execution for safety?

**Context**: Tasks run with full filesystem access and MCP permissions by default. This is powerful but potentially dangerous.

**Options**:

| Level | Restrictions | Pros | Cons |
|-------|--------------|------|------|
| **Trust** | No restrictions, full access | Maximum capability, no friction | Risk of unintended changes |
| **Whitelist** | Per-task allowed tools and paths | Prevents accidents, auditable | Requires upfront configuration |
| **Sandbox** | Isolated environment, copy-on-write | Complete safety, rollback-able | Complex setup, limited integration |

**Recommendation**: **Whitelist** for production tasks, Trust for experimentation. Document security best practices.

**Your Input Needed**:
- How comfortable are you with Claude Code making autonomous file changes?
- Should tasks have read-only mode as default, requiring explicit write permission?
- Do you want a "dry run" mode that shows what would be done without executing?

---

### 7. Open Source Positioning

**Question**: What's the target audience and positioning for the open source release?

**Options**:

| Positioning | Description | Target Audience | Differentiation |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Personal Automation** | "Automate your daily tasks with Claude Code" | Individual developers, power users | Simplicity, quick setup, personal use cases |
| **Developer Workflows** | "CI/CD and automation for Claude Code" | Development teams, DevOps | GitHub Actions integration, team features |
| **AI Agent Framework** | "Build autonomous AI agents with Claude" | AI enthusiasts, researchers | Advanced orchestration, multi-agent systems |

**Recommendation**: **Personal Automation** for initial release. This aligns with your use cases (email, todos, projects) and is most accessible. Can expand to other positions later.

**Your Input Needed**:
- Who do you envision using Clodputer?
- What problem statement resonates: "Save time on daily tasks" vs. "Automate your development workflow" vs. "Build AI agents"?
- Do you want to focus on non-technical users, developers, or both?

---

### 8. Existing Tool Leverage

**Question**: Should we integrate with existing automation tools or build standalone?

**Context**: Tools like **n8n**, **Zapier**, **Home Assistant**, **Airflow** already handle scheduling and workflows.

**Options**:

| Approach | Description | Pros | Cons |
|----------|-------------|------|------|
| **Standalone** | Clodputer handles everything | Self-contained, simple install | Reinventing scheduling/monitoring |
| **Integration Layer** | Clodputer = Claude Code adapter for existing tools | Leverage mature ecosystems | Requires users to run additional services |
| **Hybrid** | Standalone + optional integrations | Best of both worlds | More code to maintain |

**Recommendation**: **Standalone** for MVP (using cron), **Hybrid** in later phases (provide n8n/Zapier nodes as community contributions).

**Your Input Needed**:
- Do you currently use any automation tools (n8n, Home Assistant, Zapier)?
- Would you prefer Clodputer to be standalone, or a plugin/integration for another system?
- Is "just works on macOS with cron" sufficient, or do you need cross-platform support?

## Implementation Sequencing Questions

### Minimal Viable Product Scope

To validate the concept quickly, which of these is **essential** for your MVP?

- [ ] **Cron-scheduled tasks** (e.g., daily email management)
- [ ] **File watcher triggers** (e.g., new project files)
- [ ] **Todo list integration** (@claude tags)
- [ ] **Multi-turn conversations** (sequential task execution)
- [ ] **Session management** (context across multiple prompts)
- [ ] **Resource limits** (max concurrent instances)
- [ ] **Error retry logic**
- [ ] **Cost tracking**

**Recommendation**: Start with just **cron-scheduled tasks** + **file watcher triggers**. This validates the core concept with minimal code. Add others based on actual usage.

---

### Development Timeline Preferences

**Question**: What's your preferred development pace?

| Timeline | MVP Scope | Time Investment |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Fast Track (1 week)** | Single cron task + basic file watcher | 10-15 hours |
| **Standard (2-3 weeks)** | Full Phase 1 + multi-turn support | 30-40 hours |
| **Comprehensive (1-2 months)** | All phases, production-ready | 60-80 hours |

**Your Input Needed**:
- How urgently do you need this working?
- Are you building this primarily for personal use, or to release publicly?
- Would you prefer iterative releases (weekly improvements) or one comprehensive launch?

---

### Testing & Validation Approach

**Question**: How should we validate that Clodputer works correctly?

**Options**:
- **Manual Testing**: Run tasks, verify outputs by hand
- **Automated Tests**: Unit tests for scripts, integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- **Dogfooding**: Use Clodputer to automate your own tasks for 1-2 weeks before public release

**Recommendation**: **Dogfooding** is essential. Run it yourself for at least 2 weeks, iterate based on real-world friction points.

**Your Input Needed**:
- Which specific tasks will you use to validate Clodputer?
- What's your success criteria? ("Saves me X hours per week", "Reduces friction in Y workflow")

## Recommended MVP Configuration

Based on common-sense defaults, here's a proposed MVP scope for rapid validation:

### Included in MVP
✅ **Cron-scheduled tasks** (daily email management)
✅ **File watcher** (project assignment queue)
✅ **Simple YAML configuration** (easy to understand)
✅ **JSON output parsing** (success/failure detection)
✅ **Basic logging** (execution history)
✅ **On-demand instance spawning** (simple, fault-isolated)
✅ **macOS-first** (using cron + fswatch)

### Deferred to Phase 2
⏸️ Multi-turn conversations (validate need first)
⏸️ Session pooling (add only if latency is problematic)
⏸️ Advanced error handling (retry logic, alerting)
⏸️ Cost tracking (manual monitoring initially)
⏸️ Web dashboard (CLI-only for MVP)

### Target Metrics for MVP Success
- [ ] Email management task runs successfully 7 days in a row
- [ ] File watcher detects and processes 3+ project files
- [ ] Total development time < 20 hours
- [ ] Installation takes < 10 minutes for new users
- [ ] Can share with 1-2 friends who successfully set it up
