# Archive: Planning Process Documents

This folder contains the **intermediate and historical documents** from the Clodputer planning process. These documents show the decision-making journey but are **not part of the final specification**.

## Why These Are Archived

The main planning folder contains only the **final planning documents** that describe what we're building. These archived documents show **how we got there** - the research, analysis, and decision-making process.

## What's In Here

### Research & Analysis
- **00-research-summary.md** - Initial research on Claude Code capabilities, existing tools, and technical validation
- **01-project-overview.md** - Early use case exploration and requirements gathering
- **02-technical-architecture.md** - Analysis of 4 different architecture options (on-demand vs. session pool, etc.)

### Decision Process
- **03-implementation-plan.md** - Detailed phased implementation plan (now incorporated into finalized spec)
- **04-decision-matrix.md** - Questions and trade-offs considered during planning
- **CONSISTENCY-UPDATES.md** - Internal review notes from final documentation pass

## How to Use These

**For the engineer review**: Start with the core documents in the parent folder. Reference these only if you want deeper context on:
- Why we chose on-demand spawning over session pooling
- What alternatives we considered for various design decisions
- The research process and validation steps

**Key insight**: These documents represent ~2 hours of research and iteration. The final spec (in parent folder) represents the **conclusions** from this process.
