# Implementation Documentation

This folder contains **working documents** for tracking implementation progress and decisions.

## 📄 Documents

### [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md)
**Main implementation tracker** - Use this as your working document!

- ✅ Checkbox-based task tracking
- 📝 Notes sections for each task
- 🎯 Organized by phases (Tracer Bullet → Core → Automation → Polish)
- 📊 Space for blockers, decisions, and observations
- 🔄 Updated continuously during development

**How to use**:
1. Check off tasks as you complete them
2. Add notes about implementation details, challenges, or decisions
3. Document blockers in the "Blockers & Issues" section
4. Update "Last Updated" date when making changes
5. Keep it current - this is the source of truth for progress

## 🆚 vs. Planning Docs

| Planning Docs (`docs/planning/`) | Implementation Docs (`docs/implementation/`) |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| ✅ **Static** - Frozen after planning | 🔄 **Living** - Updated during development |
| 📋 What to build & why | ✅ What's been built & how |
| 🎯 A+ grade engineering spec | 📊 Real-time progress tracking |
| 📚 Reference material | 📝 Working documents |

**Planning docs** = The blueprint
**Implementation docs** = The build log

## 🚀 Getting Started

**If you're starting implementation**:
1. Read [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md)
2. Start with "Phase 0: Tracer Bullet"
3. Check off tasks as you complete them
4. Add notes about your implementation approach
5. Document any deviations from the plan

**If you're continuing work**:
1. Check PROGRESS.md for current status
2. Read notes from previous work
3. Continue from the next unchecked task
4. Update as you go

## 📝 Adding New Documents
