# Clodputer Implementation Progress

**Status**: üöÄ Implementation Starting
**Last Updated**: October 7, 2025
**Current Phase**: Tracer Bullet (Core Executor)

---

## üéØ Implementation Strategy

Following the **"Tracer Bullet" approach** recommended by expert engineer:
1. Prove core interaction first (Task Executor end-to-end)
2. Build infrastructure around proven core
3. Add `doctor` diagnostics incrementally
4. Use structured logging from the start

---

## Phase 0: Tracer Bullet - Prove Core Interaction

**Goal**: Make `clodputer run <task>` work end-to-end with a single hardcoded task

### Tracer Bullet Checklist

- [x] **Create minimal Task Executor** (`src/clodputer/executor.py`)
  - [x] Load a single hardcoded `email-management.yaml` config
  - [x] Parse YAML with PyYAML
  - [x] Build `claude -p "..."` command
  - [x] Execute command (implemented with `subprocess.Popen` to support PID capture)
  - [x] Capture stdout/stderr
  - [x] Print captured output to console
  - **Notes**: `python -m clodputer.executor` now runs end-to-end; uses `CLODPUTER_CONFIG_PATH`/`CLODPUTER_CLAUDE_BIN` overrides for flexibility.

- [x] **Implement PID-tracked cleanup** (`src/clodputer/cleanup.py`)
  - [x] Get Claude Code process PID from `subprocess.Popen`
  - [x] Use `psutil.Process(pid).children(recursive=True)` to find all children
  - [x] Send SIGTERM to parent and all children
  - [x] Wait 5 seconds (via `psutil.wait_procs` with a 5s timeout)
  - [x] Send SIGKILL to any still running
  - [x] Log all killed PIDs
  - [x] Search for orphaned `mcp__*` processes as backup
  - **Notes**: Returns a `CleanupReport` summarising terminated/killed/orphaned PIDs and logs the details.

- [x] **Create test YAML config** (`test-task.yaml`)
  - [x] Simple email management task
  - [x] Uses only Read/Write tools (no MCPs for initial test)
  - [x] Short, quick execution (< 30 seconds)
  - **Notes**: Added `email-management.yaml` tracer config at repo root; prompts Claude to emit a single-line JSON summary for deterministic testing.

- [ ] **Test end-to-end**
  - [x] Run: `python -m clodputer.executor`
  - [x] Verify Claude Code executes
  - [x] Verify output captured
  - [x] Verify all processes cleaned up (check `ps aux | grep mcp`)
  - [x] No orphaned processes remain
  - **Notes**: Real Claude CLI run (`CLODPUTER_CLAUDE_BIN=/Users/ro/.claude/local/claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`) produced the expected JSON response and exited cleanly. `ps` only showed pre-existing long-lived Claude/MCP helpers (start times days prior); no new processes remained after execution.

**‚úÖ Tracer Bullet Complete When**: Can run a task, capture output, and clean up perfectly. This proves the riskiest part works.

## Phase 1: Core Implementation

**Goal**: Functional MVP with queue + execution + logging

### 1.1 Repository Setup

- [x] **Initialize repository**
  - [x] Clone repo to local machine
  - [x] Create src-layout directory structure
  - [x] Add pyproject.toml with dependencies
  - [x] Create .gitignore
  - [x] Add planning docs to docs/planning/
  - [x] Initial commit and push
  - **Completed**: October 7, 2025

### 1.2 Queue Manager

- [x] **Implement QueueManager class** (`src/clodputer/queue.py`)
  - [x] Load/save queue from JSON file (`~/.clodputer/queue.json`)
  - [x] Implement atomic writes (temp file + rename)
  - [x] `enqueue(task_name, priority='normal')` method
  - [x] `get_next_task()` method (respects priority)
  - [x] `mark_running(task_id, pid)` method
  - [x] `mark_completed(task_id, result)` method
  - [x] `mark_failed(task_id, error)` method
  - [x] `get_status()` method for display
  - **Notes**: Queue state tracked via dataclasses with UUID task IDs, persisted after every mutation; smoke-tested in an isolated temp directory.

- [x] **Implement lockfile mechanism**
  - [x] Create lock at `~/.clodputer/clodputer.lock` on start
  - [x] Write current PID to lockfile
  - [x] Check for stale locks (PID not running)
  - [x] Clean up lockfile on exit
  - [x] Handle crashes gracefully
  - **Notes**: `QueueManager` auto-acquires the lock and removes stale files; exposes context-manager + `release_lock` for orderly shutdowns.

- [x] **Queue state management**
  - [x] Define JSON schema for queue.json
  - [x] Handle queue corruption (validate on load)
  - [x] Support high/normal priority
  - [x] Prevent duplicate task IDs
  - **Notes**: State serialised with a deterministic schema (`QueueState`); loader raises `QueueCorruptionError` on parse issues and priorities enforced in `_sorted_queue`.

- [x] **Add `doctor` diagnostic** (incremental)
  - [x] Check for stale lockfile
  - [x] Validate queue.json is valid JSON
  - [x] Check queue state is consistent
  - **Notes**: Introduced `lockfile_status()` and `QueueManager.validate_state()` helpers for upcoming `clodputer doctor` integration.

### 1.3 Task Executor (Full Implementation)

- [x] **Config loader** (`src/clodputer/config.py`)
  - [x] Define Pydantic models for TaskConfig
  - [x] Load YAML files from `~/.clodputer/tasks/`
  - [x] Validate with Pydantic
  - [x] Implement environment variable substitution (`{{ env.VAR }}`)
  - [x] Handle config errors with clear messages
  - **Notes**: Added `validate_all_tasks()` for diagnostics and env substitution with clear `ConfigError` reporting.

- [x] **Executor improvements** (`src/clodputer/executor.py`)
  - [x] Accept task name instead of hardcoded path
  - [x] Load config using ConfigLoader
  - [x] Build Claude Code command with all flags (tools, permissions)
  - [x] Add timeout support from config
  - [x] Parse JSON output from Claude Code
  - [x] Handle execution errors
  - **Notes**: `TaskExecutor` now processes queue items, parses fenced JSON, and distinguishes success/timeout/failure while emitting structured logs.

- [x] **Integration with queue**
  - [x] Executor pulls tasks from queue
  - [x] Updates queue state (running ‚Üí completed/failed)
  - [x] Logs all state transitions
  - **Notes**: Uses `QueueManager` for state transitions and records config/disabled failures via `record_failure`.

- [x] **Add `doctor` diagnostic** (incremental)
  - [x] Validate all task YAML files
  - [x] Check Pydantic validation passes
  - [x] List tasks with validation errors
  - **Notes**: `clodputer doctor` surfaces config errors, lockfile state, and queue validation issues.

- [x] **Implement StructuredLogger** (`src/clodputer/logger.py`)
  - [x] Log events as JSON lines
  - [x] Support event types: task_started, task_completed, task_failed
  - [x] Include timestamp, task_name, duration, status
  - [x] Write to `~/.clodputer/execution.log`
  - **Notes**: Rotation kicks in at 10‚ÄØMB and archives to `~/.clodputer/archive/YYYY-MM.log`.

- [x] **Log formatting for CLI**
  - [x] Parse JSON log entries
  - [x] Format as human-readable output
  - [x] Color coding (‚úÖ success, ‚ùå failure)
  - [x] Support filtering by date/task
  - **Notes**: `clodputer logs` tail/follow output with task filters; `status` summarises recent history and daily stats.

- [x] **Log rotation**
  - [x] Detect when log exceeds 10 MB
  - [x] Archive to `~/.clodputer/archive/YYYY-MM.log`
  - [x] Create fresh log file
  - [ ] Keep archives for 6 months
  - **Notes**: Archive retention trimming deferred; rotation and archive naming implemented.

  - **Notes**: `generate_cron_section` builds a managed block with log redirection to `~/.clodputer/cron.log`.

- [x] **Implement `clodputer install`**
  - [x] Backup existing crontab
  - [x] Add Clodputer section to crontab
  - [x] Install all scheduled tasks
  - [x] Verify installation succeeded

  - [x] Check if cron daemon is running
  - [x] Verify cron jobs are installed
  - [x] Check cron job syntax
  - **Notes**: `doctor` now checks cron daemon presence, ensures scheduled tasks map to installed jobs, and validates cron definitions.

### 2.2 File Watcher

- [x] **File watcher implementation** (`src/clodputer/watcher.py`)
  - [x] Use watchdog library for cross-platform watching
  - [x] Monitor configured directories
  - [x] Match file patterns (glob)
  - [x] Debounce file events (wait for writes to complete)
  - [x] Enqueue tasks when files match
  - **Notes**: `run_watch_service` schedules per-task handlers, respects per-config debounce, and enqueues via `QueueManager` with metadata.

- [x] **Watcher daemon mode**
  - [x] Run in background as daemon
  - [x] Log to `~/.clodputer/watcher.log`
  - [x] Handle crashes and restarts
  - [x] PID file for process management
  - **Notes**: `start_daemon` spawns a multiprocessing process, records PID, and the loop reloads configs on errors with logged retries.

## Notes & Decisions

### Key Technical Decisions

- **Tracer bullet approach**: Prove core interaction first before building infrastructure
- **Structured logging**: JSON internally, formatted for CLI display
- **Incremental `doctor`**: Build diagnostics as we build components
- **PID-tracked cleanup**: Primary method with name-based backup
- **Atomic writes**: All state changes use temp file + rename
- **Environment variables**: Secrets kept out of config files
