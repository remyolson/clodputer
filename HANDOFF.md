   - Complete setup instructions
   - Development workflow
   - Code style guidelines
   - First task guidance

2. **Review** [docs/planning/00-START-HERE.md](docs/planning/00-START-HERE.md) (5 minutes)
   - Project overview
   - Key decisions
   - Engineer assessment

3. **Open** [docs/implementation/PROGRESS.md](docs/implementation/PROGRESS.md) (ongoing)
   - Your implementation roadmap
   - Check off tasks as you complete them
   - Add notes about your approach

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Clone repository (if not already done)
git clone https://github.com/remyolson/clodputer.git
cd clodputer

# Set up development environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Open the main docs
open CONTRIBUTING.md
open docs/implementation/PROGRESS.md
```

## 🎯 Implementation Strategy

### The "Tracer Bullet" Approach

**Expert engineer recommendation**: Don't build everything in parallel. Prove the core first.

**Phase 0 (Start Here): Tracer Bullet**
- **Goal**: Make `clodputer run <task>` work end-to-end with a single hardcoded task
- **Why**: Proves the most critical and risky part works (Claude Code interaction + cleanup)
- **Duration**: Focus on this until it works perfectly
- **Success**: Can run a task, capture output, clean up all processes

**Once tracer bullet works**: Build infrastructure around the proven core.

**Phases** (detailed in PROGRESS.md):
- Phase 0: Tracer Bullet (prove core)
- Phase 1: Core Implementation (queue, logging, CLI)
- Phase 2: Automation Triggers (cron, file watcher)
- Phase 3: Polish & Release

## 📚 Essential Documentation

### Must-Read (Before You Write Code)

## 🔑 Key Technical Decisions (Already Made)

These are **finalized and approved** by expert engineer:

### Architecture
- ✅ On-demand spawning (new Claude Code instance per task)
- ✅ Sequential queue only (no concurrency in MVP)
- ✅ PID-tracked process cleanup (prevents MCP leaks)
- ✅ Atomic queue writes (prevents corruption)
- ✅ macOS-first (Linux/Windows deferred)

### Technology Stack
- ✅ Python 3.9+ (orchestration)
- ✅ Click 8.x (CLI framework)
- ✅ Pydantic 2.x (config validation)
- ✅ psutil (process management)
- ✅ watchdog (file watching)
- ✅ rumps (macOS menu bar)
- ✅ PyYAML (config parsing)

### Safety & Security
- ✅ Multi-layer CLAUDE.md protection (backup, append-only, atomic writes)
- ✅ PID tracking for process cleanup (safer than name-based)
- ✅ Environment variable substitution for secrets
- ✅ Lockfile to prevent concurrent queue managers
- ✅ Path validation to prevent traversal attacks

### User Experience
- ✅ Menu bar icon (status visibility)
- ✅ Terminal-based dashboard (no web UI in MVP)
- ✅ CLI for quick status checks
- ✅ Claude Code conversations as primary interface
- ✅ Structured JSON logging (formatted for CLI display)

**These decisions have been reviewed and approved. Don't second-guess them—implement them.**

## ⚠️ Critical Implementation Reminders

### 1. Build `doctor` Incrementally

Don't save diagnostics for the end. As you build each component:

- Queue manager done? → Add "check stale lockfile" to `doctor`
- Config loader done? → Add "validate all YAMLs" to `doctor`
- Cron installer done? → Add "check cron jobs" to `doctor`

This makes `doctor` your debugging tool during development.

### 2. Use Structured Logging from Day 1

```python
# Log as JSON internally
log.info({
    "event": "task_completed",
    "task_name": task.name,
    "duration_sec": duration,
    "status": "success"
})

# CLI formats for display
print(f"✅ {timestamp} | {task_name} | {duration}s | Success")
```

Makes future dashboard trivial to build.

### 3. PID Tracking is Primary

When cleaning up processes:
1. PRIMARY: Track PIDs using `psutil.Process().children()`
2. BACKUP: Search for `mcp__*` processes by name

Never rely solely on name-based cleanup.

### 4. Update PROGRESS.md as You Go

- Check off tasks when completed
- Add notes about your approach
- Document blockers and decisions
- Commit changes regularly

## 🤝 Getting Help

### If You Get Stuck

1. **Check the planning docs** - Answer is likely there
2. **Look at implementation details** - Has code examples
3. **Document in PROGRESS.md** under "Blockers & Issues"
4. **Reach out** to project maintainer

### Questions to Ask the Planning Docs

- "How should I implement X?" → Check 05-finalized-specification.md
- "What library should I use?" → Check 10-implementation-details.md
- "How do I ensure safety?" → Check 09-safety-features.md
- "What did the engineer say about X?" → Search for "Engineer's" in docs
