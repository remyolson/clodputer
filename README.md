Clodputer is a lightweight macOS automation framework that enables Claude Code to work autonomously through cron schedules and file watchers.

## ⚠️ Project Status

**Currently in development.** Planning phase complete (A+ grade from expert engineer review). Implementation in progress.

See [docs/planning](docs/planning/) for complete technical specifications and design decisions.

## Quick Overview

**What**: Lightweight automation tool for Claude Code
**Why**: Enable "set it and forget it" automation
**How**: On-demand spawning, sequential queue, aggressive cleanup

### Key Use Cases

- **Daily Email Management**: Draft responses at 8 AM automatically
- **Project Assignment Queue**: Drop project files, Claude executes autonomously
- **Todo List Automation**: Tag tasks with `@claude`, they get done

## Features (Planned)

- ✅ Cron-scheduled tasks
- ✅ File watcher triggers
- ✅ YAML configuration with Pydantic validation
- ✅ PID-tracked process cleanup (prevents MCP leaks)
- ✅ Atomic queue writes (prevents corruption)
- ✅ Secret management (environment variable substitution)
- ✅ Menu bar status indicator
- ✅ `clodputer doctor` diagnostics command
- ✅ Structured JSON logging

## Architecture Highlights

- **Sequential execution**: One task at a time (simple, reliable)
- **Production-grade safety**: PID tracking, atomic writes, backups
- **AI-native design**: Claude Code generates YAML configs
- **macOS-first**: Using native tools (cron, watchdog)

## Engineer Review

> "**A+ Plan. This is the Green Light.** The project is exceptionally well-prepared for implementation. The level of detail in your specifications now rivals what I would expect from a seasoned team in a professional environment."

> "My confidence in this project is extremely high. My final recommendation is unequivocal: **Stop planning and start building.**"

## Installation

_Coming soon. Repository structure being set up._

## Development

This project follows the "tracer bullet" implementation approach:
1. **Days 1-2**: Prove core interaction (Task Executor end-to-end)
2. **Week 1**: Queue manager + logging + CLI
3. **Week 2**: Automation triggers (cron + file watcher)
4. **Week 3**: Polish + open source release

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.9+**: Orchestration
- **Click**: CLI framework
- **Pydantic**: Config validation
- **psutil**: Process management (PID-tracked cleanup)
- **watchdog**: File watching
- **rumps**: macOS menu bar
- **PyYAML**: Configuration parsing
